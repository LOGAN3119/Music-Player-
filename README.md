# MusicPlayer Using Linkedlist

#PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To make a basic music player using the knowledge of various Data structures learnt as part of course CSL214 - Data Structures and Program Design - II. In this, Data structures used are a doubly linked list, stacks and queues.
File handling to read and write songs has also been used.

#LIST OF ERRORS:

#KEY OR CHALLENGING LOGIC:
The major part of the challenge included making a doubly linked list that would accept string data and store it efficiently. Involving the usage of file handling was another challenge. To retrieve songs from a pre-made list and add it to the linked list. It also required us to be able to write the new input songs to the file. All changes in the program required to be reflected on the text file.

#PREQUISITES:
To use the File handling part of the program a text file of name “playlist.txt” with certain data elements is required.
Sample data elements-
Animals,
Spaceman,
Apollo,
Care,
Fragile,
Melody.
